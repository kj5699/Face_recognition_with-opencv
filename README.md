## Face_recognition_with-opencv

In this project , we have implemented Face Recognition using opencv and Python.



  

  ##### How to Run:

  Step By Step Approach:

  Run Create_dataset.py  to create your own custom dataset for your Face

  `python Extract_Embeddings.py`

  

  Run train.py to generate trained model.

  `python train.py`

  

  Run face_predict.py to see the results:

  `python recognize.py` or
  
  if you want to see output on sample image
  
  `python recognize_images.py`
